### [User Behavior in an Educational Social Network (Part 1)](https://github.com/enriqueulloap/portfolio/blob/master/User%20Behavior%20in%20an%20Educational%20Social%20Network%20(Part%201).ipynb)

In this project, I built a Pipeline to load unstructured data into a MongoDB database to determine what information we must extract to analyze the user behavior in an Educational Social Network.


### Omnichannel Sales Dashboard

This dashboard was created to support the omnichannel strategy of a bank, showing information for all its products and channels. It gathers data from the different platforms used in the company, i.e. retail stores, bank offices, website, mobile applications, telemarketing, ATM, etc.

### Credit and Debit Cards Report

This report shows new cardholders and customers getting a product upgrade. It features charts and rankings with the best and worst store performances. Before this report, the managers had no way of knowing their performance during weekends, the days with the largest influx of public. Now they get this report automatically in a daily and hourly basis.

### Consumer Loans Report

This report shows the Consumer Loans sold in the bank offices along with some productivity KPI. It is a redesign of another that was malfunctioning (sent with erroneous figures and late). The process was rebuilt with focus on speed and reliability.
